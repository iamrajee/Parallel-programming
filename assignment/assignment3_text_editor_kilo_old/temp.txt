hore kaushalA Simple Story is a novel by 


English author and actress, 


Elizabeth Inchbald.[1] Published 


in early 1791 as an early example of a "novel of passion", 

it was very successful and became widely read in England and abroad.[1] It went into a second edition in March 1791.[2] It is still in print today.[3] The novel is divided into four books, two each devoted to its two storylines.[4] The first two books follow the love story of young Miss Milner (we are never told her first name) and her guardian Dorriforth, a Roman Catholic priest, who later renounces his holy orders on inheriting an aristocratic title and marries Miss Milner. The last two books, set some seventeen or eighteen years later, follow the troubled relationship of Dorriforth (now Lord Elmwood) and his daughter Matilda, whom he has excluded from his life following his wife's adulterous affair and death. The book touches on issues including the education of women, Catholicism, sensibility,[4] and gender roles.
